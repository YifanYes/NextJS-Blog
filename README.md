# Next.js Blog

In this project, I've learned Next.js basics by creating a very simple blog app.

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) version 8.0 or greater installed on your system.

## Setup

Get the code by either cloning this repository using git

```
git clone https://github.com/YifanYes/NextJS-Blog.git
```

Once downloaded, open the terminal in the project directory, and install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

Then start the example app with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be up and running at http://localhost:3000 ðŸš€
